 <description>
  This package provides support for indexing XML files. It assists you in 
  creating and using such indexes in order to reduce access-time to local 
  XML files.

<release>
  <version>0.3.5</version>
  <date> 2005-02-03 </date>
  <state>alpha</state>
  <notes>
      * Reader::fetchDomNodes() now returns an array of nodes with both PHP4 and PHP5
      * Added a "profiling" option to enable/disable profiling support
      * Fixed the constructor's documentation
      * With a unsupported XPath expression, the Reader returned no results :
        it now supports bypassing the index, by performing a conventional dom xpath
        query. Works with both PHP4 and PHP5. Adds a dependency on XML_XPath.

          Minor fixes :
          * "Call-time pass-by-reference" warning in XML_Indexing_Builder : fixed, thanks
          Bertrand Gugger bertrand [at] toggg [dot] com
          * include_once was used where require_once is more appropriate, in several 
          places : fixed, thanks Bertrand Gugger bertrand [at] toggg [dot] com
          * Added optional dependency on Benchmark >= 1.2.1, required for profiling

      <notes>
          * Added DOM fetching method : fetchDomNodes()
          * WARNING: Suppressed the XML_Indexing_Reader::next() method. Fetching data
            is now performed by either fetchStrings() or fetchDomNodes()
          * Added support for /simple/xpath/expressions (that is : without any
            [n] or [@attr] specification)
          * Added support for the last() xpath function, as in /path/to/element[last()]
          * Matched regions might come up in a messed up order for certain queries : fixed 
          * Fixed a bug where some junk files where created in the system's temporary 
            directory. This fix adds a new package requirement : File ; version >= 1.0.3
          * Added profiling support to the XML_Indexing_Reader class

          * Added basic file locking to prevent concurrent processes from writing 
            simultaneously to the same index file
          * Suppressed some junk debugging output

            * First release as an official PEAR package
            * Modified version naming (x.y to x.y.z) in order to comply with the
              new Version Naming RFC.
            * Minor documentation fixes

        <notes>
            * The workaround for PHP5's Expat bug used split() with the entire
              XML file loaded into memory. That caused heavy memory usage :
              A simple for loop is now used, to avoid duplicating the XML data
              in memory. This should reduce memory usage, but this workaround
              still makes index building much heavier on PHP5 than on PHP4.
            * Added a 'gz_level' option to allow compressing the index files :
              Turned off by default.
            * Namespaces now get extracted from the XML file, and are available
              through both XML_Indexing_Reader::getNamespaces() and 
              XML_Indexing_Builder::getNamespaces(). The expat parser features
              a nifty xml_set_start_namespace_decl_handler() function for this
              purpose _but_ it is buggy. A workaround has been implemented
              (somehow heavy, see XML_Indexing_Builder::_handleStartElement())
            * Index files were stored by default in '/tmp', which would certainly
              fail on Windows : This is now dynamically generated using the
              system's default.
            * Updated documentation headers
            * Removed the XML_Indexing_Reader::create() factory method, which was 
              performing useless error checking : the constructor is now the 
              prefered way to instantiate a Reader object

  <notes>
      * Fixed a bug where /foo/bar[n] returned the n'th occurence of 
      /foo/bar in the scope of the whole document : it will now return
      the n'th occurences of bar in the scope of foo. Thanks Christian 
      Stocker 
      * Fixing the above bug has a consequence : searching for /foo/bar[n]
      may now return several occurences, instead of a single one in the prior
      implementation : the numeric index format got modified consequently.
